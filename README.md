# OlMcdonaldFarm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6.

There are 2 main pages - /auto and /manual - the /auto page contains a bunch of predefined animals with their corresponding sounds and just renders a verse for each one of them, and the /manual page does the same as well as giving us the ability to add our own animals dynamically (the state of the added animals is not preserved as that is not part of the assignment). The components are accompanied by a couple of very basic unit tests to ensure stability.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
